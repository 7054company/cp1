# This cronjob is responsible for receiving the updates of WordPress Toolkit.
# It works as following logic:
# - WPT CLI is called to receive the available update version;
# - If update is found, then the URLs to the host with repositories are updated and cache is cleared for WPT repos;
# - If WPT CLI is failed (e.g. unable to communicate with update service or WPT is completely broken), then
# the cronjob executes wp-toolkit-installer script to set the default URLs to host with repositories;
# - Finally the yum update is called to install latest available version.
